# [unnamed] Programming Language

Is there a standard term for before pre-alpha?

Don't use this language. This is my playground for an idea of a programming language. Maybe one day it will be more than
that. For now, I'd recommend reading the parser code. It uses
[a parser combinator library that I wrote](https://github.com/MCluck90/parsnip-ts) and I think it's pretty neat.

Here there be dragons.
