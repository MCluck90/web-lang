# [unnamed] Programming Language

Is there a standard term for before pre-alpha?

Don't use this language. This is my playground for an idea of a programming language. Maybe one day it will be more than
that. The goal is to create a single language that works on the frontend and backend while handling interop between the two automatically.

Here there be dragons.
